# Bee System

## Overview

The Bee system (`bee.zig`) implements autonomous bee agents that collect pollen from flowers and convert it to honey. Each bee has its own AI state machine, lifecycle, and visual representation. The system is designed to create emergent behavior through simple rules.

## Bee Structure

### Core Properties

```zig
pub const Bee = struct {
    // Positioning
    position: rl.Vector2,
    
    // Visual properties
    texture: rl.Texture,
    width: f32,           // 32 pixels
    height: f32,          // 32 pixels
    scale: f32,           // Base scale (1.0)
    effectiveScale: f32,  // Adjusted for grid zoom
    
    // AI and targeting
    targetFlowerIndex: ?usize,
    targetLock: bool,
    
    // Lifecycle
    timeAlive: f32,
    timeSpan: f32,        // 30-70 seconds lifespan
    dead: bool,
    
    // Gameplay mechanics
    carryingPollen: bool,
    pollenCollected: f32,
    
    // Development
    debug: bool,
}
```

## Bee Lifecycle

### Initialization

New bees are created with:
- Random position within grid bounds
- Random lifespan between 30-70 seconds
- No pollen collected initially
- Target acquisition disabled initially

### Aging and Death

Bees follow a simple aging system:
- `timeAlive` increases each frame by `deltaTime`
- When `timeAlive` exceeds `timeSpan`, bee dies
- Dead bees are removed from the game during cleanup

## AI Behavior System

### State Machine

The bee AI operates on a simple state machine:

1. **Target Acquisition** - When `targetLock` is false
2. **Movement** - When `targetLock` is true and target exists
3. **Pollen Collection** - When arriving at a flower with pollen
4. **Target Release** - When arriving at any flower

### Target Acquisition Algorithm

The `findNearestFlower` function implements a sophisticated targeting system:

**Phase 1: Priority Search**
- Scans all flowers for mature ones (state 4) with pollen
- Calculates distance to each viable flower
- Records the minimum distance found

**Phase 2: Randomization**
- Collects all flowers within 125% of minimum distance
- This creates a "close enough" group to prevent all bees targeting the same flower
- Randomly selects from this group

**Phase 3: Fallback**
- If no flowers with pollen exist, targets any living flower
- Ensures bees don't become idle when no pollen is available

### Movement System

**Leap Factor Movement:**
- Uses interpolation for smooth movement: `position += (target - position) * leapFactor * deltaTime`
- Leap factor of 0.9 creates natural, organic movement
- Accounts for frame rate variations through `deltaTime`

**Arrival Detection:**
- Arrival threshold of 5.0 pixels for reliable detection
- Prevents oscillation around target positions

## Pollen Collection Mechanics

### Collection Rules

Bees can collect pollen when:
- Target flower is mature (state == 4)
- Target flower has pollen (`hasPolen == true`)
- Bee is within arrival threshold of flower

### Collection Effects

When pollen is collected:
1. Flower's pollen is consumed (`flower.collectPolen()`)
2. Bee state changes to carrying pollen
3. Pollen counter increments by 1
4. Target lock is released for new target acquisition

## Honey Production

### Conversion System

- Each pollen collected equals 1 honey unit
- Honey is tracked in the main game loop
- Production occurs during the update phase

### Production Tracking

The game engine monitors:
- Previous pollen count before update
- Current pollen count after update
- Difference is added to global honey reserves

## Visual Representation

### Rendering System

**Normal State:**
- Renders bee texture with white tint
- Uses `effectiveScale` for proper grid scaling

**Pollen Carrying State:**
- Renders bee texture with yellow tint
- Provides immediate visual feedback

### Scale Management

The `updateScale` function ensures bees:
- Scale properly with grid zoom changes
- Maintain consistent appearance ratio
- Formula: `effectiveScale = scale * (gridScale / 3.0)`

## Flower Spawning Behavior

### Spawning Mechanics

Bees carrying pollen can spawn new flowers:
- 10% chance per second while carrying pollen
- Spawning occurs at the bee's current position
- Pollen is consumed when spawning succeeds

### Spawning Logic

The spawning system:
1. Converts bee world position to grid coordinates
2. Checks for existing flowers at the target position
3. Revives dead flowers or creates new ones
4. Resets bee's pollen carrying state

## Performance Considerations

### Optimization Features

**Efficient Target Finding:**
- Uses squared distance for initial comparisons (faster than sqrt)
- Only calculates actual distance when needed
- Limits search to living flowers only

**Memory Management:**
- Uses page allocator for temporary collections
- Properly cleans up dynamic arrays
- Minimal memory allocation per frame

### Scalability

The system can handle multiple bees efficiently:
- O(n*m) complexity where n = bees, m = flowers
- Reasonable performance for typical game scales
- Could be optimized with spatial partitioning if needed

## Configuration Values

```zig
const ARRIVAL_THRESHOLD = 5.0;      // Distance for arrival detection
const LEAP_FACTOR = 0.9;            // Movement interpolation speed
const DISTANCE_TOLERANCE = 1.25;    // Randomization factor for targeting
const LIFESPAN_MIN = 30.0;          // Minimum bee lifespan (seconds)
const LIFESPAN_MAX = 70.0;          // Maximum bee lifespan (seconds)
const SPRITE_SIZE = 32.0;           // Bee sprite dimensions
```

## Future Improvements

### Planned Features

1. **Bee Types** - Different bee species with unique abilities
2. **Swarm Intelligence** - Bees communicate about flower locations
3. **Pathfinding** - Navigate around obstacles
4. **Seasonal Behavior** - Different behavior patterns over time
5. **Bee Upgrades** - Longer lifespan, faster movement, more pollen capacity

### AI Enhancements

1. **Flocking Behavior** - Bees influence each other's movement
2. **Memory System** - Remember recently visited flowers
3. **Efficiency Optimization** - Prefer closer flowers more strongly
4. **Predictive Targeting** - Target flowers likely to have pollen soon

### Technical Improvements

1. **Spatial Partitioning** - Optimize flower searching with quadtree
2. **Behavior Trees** - More complex AI decision making
3. **Animation System** - Smooth sprite animation for movement
4. **Sound Integration** - Buzzing sounds and audio feedback
